# ACORN Timetable Rainbow

This Chrome extension changes your ACORN timetable colours from all blue to (blue + other colours)! Maybe makes it easier to tell the difference between courses. 

It also adds an easy "Export to Image" button for your timetable, so you can easily view your schedule on your phone and offline!

To install, follow [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). 

NOTE: I only tested this on my timetable for engineering and it worked fine. Not responsible if it leaps out of your computer and devours your pets.
