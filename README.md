# ACORN Timetable Rainbow

This Chrome extension changes your ACORN timetable colours from all blue to (blue + other colours)! Maybe makes it easier to tell the difference between courses. 

To install, follow [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). 

NOTE: I only tested this on my timetable for engineering and it worked fine. Not responsible if it leaps out of your computer and devours your pets.
